            Homeopathy is a gentle and natural healing system of Medicine based on "Law of Similars" or "like Cures
            like". It means a substance which can cause symptoms when given in a large dose to a healthy person, can
            cure the same symptoms in a sick person when given in a highly diluted dose. This system of Medicine was
            developed and refined by German Physician - Chemist Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755 - 1843). One common example
            is when you cut an onion, your eyes water, burn, your nose run and itch. Allium Cepa, a homeopathic remedy
            made from red onion can help the same symptoms resulting from cold or allergies in a sick individual.

            Homeopathy treats the whole person and produces a gentle cure without the side effects. It is highly
            individualized to the patient. The Remedies are made from Plants, Minerals or Animals in a very dilute
            concentrations (like nano concentration) which makes them effective but at the same time without the toxic
            side effects. Appropriately selected Homeopathic Remedy for the individual patient, works slowly but brings
            cure in chronic conditions. So please don't expect immediate results in hours/days. Although it works fast
            in acute conditions, it takes a few weeks to bring a cure in chronic conditions.

            Our bodies have a tremendous power to heal and stay healthy. Sometimes our bodies go out of balance due to
            poor nutrition, bad lifestyle and sometimes by genetic predisposition. Due to this, the body is unable to
            heal itself and stay healthy. By focusing on child's nutrition, healthy lifestyle
            and using gentle remedies like Homeopathy, we can restore this balance and restore your child's health.
