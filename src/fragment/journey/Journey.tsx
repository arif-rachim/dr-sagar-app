            <P>I am Dr.
                Padmini Sagar and I have been a practicing pediatrician for nearly 40 years. After practicing
                Pediatrics for 10+ years, I realized that Allopathic medicine is very good in treating acute, life
                threatening illnesses and trauma etc. but has no real cures for chronic diseases. I also observed that
                there
                was an alarming increase in the rate of ADHD, Autism, Behavioral disorders, Depression, and Asthma, etc.
                That is
                when I started my focus on other complementary modalities like Herbs, Ayurveda, yoga and Meditation but
                I
                was most impressed by HOMEOPATHY and its results. After studying Homeopathy at “National center for
                Homeopathy” for 2 summers, I enrolled myself with “New England School of Homeopathy” for in-depth study
                of
                Homeopathy for 2 years. I am continuing to study under Master Homeopaths, attending various seminars and
                conferences for the past 20+ years. It is a lifelong learning! Earlier, I had incorporated some
                Homeopathy
                in my conventional Pediatric Practice for chronic conditions, if parents were willing to try. I saw
                amazing
                results without the side effects. Now I would like to treat my Pediatric Patients exclusively with
                Homeopathy and Holistic approaches.</P>
            <P>This is a Holistic Pediatric consultation only, not a primary care practice. Your child needs to have a
                primary care physician. The consultation is by Video visit only at this time.</P>
